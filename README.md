Creation of an object that will hold properties and methods. I will try TDD, therefore, I will write my test unit first, contemplate all the odds and type down later my object. based on my previous two jasmine unit tests.

Use of [**SET**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) JavaScript method in order to achieve the response.
